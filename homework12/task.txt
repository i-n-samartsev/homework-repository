Using ORM framework of your choice, create models classes created in
Homework 6 (Teachers, Students, Homework and others).

- Target database should be sqlite (filename main.db located in current
directory)
- ORM framework should support migrations.

Utilizing that framework capabilities create:
- A migration file, creating all necessary database structures.
- A migration file (separate) creating at least one record in each created
database table
- (*) Optional task: write standalone script (get_report.py) that retrieves
and stores the following information into CSV file report.csv
